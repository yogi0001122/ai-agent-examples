# Azure AI Foundry Infrastructure Samples

This repository contains Terraform configurations, sample code, and supporting assets for setting up and experimenting with Azure AI Foundry resources.
It includes end-to-end examples as well as modular snippets that demonstrate standard AI Foundry provisioning and integration workflows.

The goal of this repository is to provide a practical reference for deploying AI Foundry workspaces, projects, and service connections in a reusable and automated way.
